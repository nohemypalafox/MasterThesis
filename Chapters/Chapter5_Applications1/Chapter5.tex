\lhead{\emph{Applications: one dimensional optimal control problems}} 
    
    In this Chapter we introduce the one dimensional control problems and we 
    see how to apply the optimal control theory to them. The problems are Mold 
    and Fungicide, Bacteria and Cancer. In the first one the control represents 
    the amount of fungicide known to kill the mold. In the second one, the 
    control represents the amount of chemicals added to kill a bacteria. And in 
    the last one, the control represents the pharmacokinetics of a drug, that
    means the effect of the drug in the metabolism since the moment it enters 
    to the body until the moment it is completely eliminated.
