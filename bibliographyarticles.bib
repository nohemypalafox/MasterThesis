  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT. We develop a metapopulation harvesting model that includes density-dependent immigration and emigration and apply Pontryagin's maximum principle to derive an optimal harvesting and reserve design strategy. The model is designed to mimic the black bear population of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. Model results suggest that a forest region's population can be maintained despite high harvest levels due to emigration from a connected, un-harvested park region. The amount of shared border between the park and forest region is important in determining the optimal harvesting strategy. This technique offers new insight on the spatial control of protected populations.},

 tuberculosis (TB) may not only lead to relapse but also to the development of 
 antibiotic resistant TB---one of the most serious health problems facing society 
 today. In this article, we formulate one-strain and two-strain TB models to determine 
 possible mechanisms that may allow for the survival and spread of naturally resistant 
 strains of TB as well as antibiotic-generated resistant strains of TB. Analysis of our 
 models shows that non-antibiotic co-existence is possible but rare for naturally 
 resistant strains while co-existence is almost the rule for strains that result from 
 the lack of compliance with antibiotic treatment by TB infected individuals.},

                            This paper shows that if a differentiable function F has a finite lower 
                            bound (although it need not attain it), then, for every ϵ > 0, there
